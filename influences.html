            <h2>Graffiti has had a significant influence on his work, teaching him the importance of improvisation, collaboration, and speed. Borsche cites designers Pierre Mendell and Jost Hochuli’s book ‘Detail in Typography’ as inspirations. His pivotal experience came when he worked on a magazine for the Süddeutsche Zeitung, one of Germany’s largest daily newspapers.</h2>

            <h3>&#34This magazine targeted young people and had virtually no budget, which allowed us to explore our creativity. I had the freedom to create my own illustrations since we needed to cut costs on photoshoots. Some notable photographers, like Jurgen Teller and Wolfgang Tillmans, started their careers there, and I learned to navigate the challenges of limited resources. This experience reignited my passion for graphic design.&#34</h3>

            <h4>Borsche’s work is influenced by a lot of design styles, the main ones being Swiss or International Style and Minimalism. He uses very clean designs and shows editorial influence through his work. He also enjoys adding illustrations. He believes that good design must be simple and easy to understand.</h4>
